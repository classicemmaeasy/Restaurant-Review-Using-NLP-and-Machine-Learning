# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

This project explores the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand restaurant reviews and classify them based on sentiment. By analyzing customer feedback, this system helps businesses gain valuable insights into customer opinions and improve their services accordingly.

## Why Sentiment Analysis?

In todayâ€™s competitive market, understanding customer feedback has become more crucial than ever. Sentiment analysis enables restaurant owners and managers to quickly gauge how customers feel about their dining experience. This insight is invaluable for:

- **Identifying Strengths:** Highlighting what customers love, such as specific dishes, friendly service, or a cozy atmosphere.
- **Addressing Weaknesses:** Spotting common complaints or issues like slow service or a noisy environment, allowing for timely improvements.
- **Enhancing Customer Satisfaction:** By understanding and acting on customer feedback, restaurants can tailor their offerings and services to better meet expectations, creating a more satisfying dining experience.

## Project Workflow: Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

### 1. Data Preprocessing

The process began with a diverse dataset of restaurant reviews. The text was cleaned and prepared for analysis through several steps:

- **Lowercasing:** Ensuring consistency by converting all text to lowercase.
- **Punctuation Removal:** Stripping away unnecessary punctuation to reduce noise.
- **Tokenization:** Breaking down sentences into individual words or tokens.

### 2. Custom Stopwords

An important part of preprocessing involved deciding which words to keep or remove. While standard stopwords are typically removed, I identified that certain words like "not" or "but" play a key role in determining sentiment. This led to the creation of a custom stopword list, helping retain contextually significant words during analysis.

### 3. Feature Extraction

To convert the cleaned text into numerical data suitable for machine learning models, I used techniques like **CountVectorizer**. This step enabled the model to recognize patterns in word usage across positive and negative reviews.

### 4. Sentiment Classification: Building the Model

With the features ready, I trained a machine learning model using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm to classify the sentiment of reviews. SVM is particularly effective for textual data due to its ability to handle high-dimensional feature spaces efficiently.

### 5. Key Insights and Learnings

This project emphasized the importance of retaining critical words that influence sentiment interpretation. Words like "not" can completely change the meaning of a sentence, making the use of custom stopwords essential in the preprocessing stage. Through careful tuning, the model became not only accurate but also contextually aware of subtle language nuances.
